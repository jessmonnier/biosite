            <p>
                Ryan Monnier is approaching his mid-thirties and is still (or rather, once again) in training in the Air Force. 
                It has become something of a running joke: Can he set some sort of record for the amount of time spent in official 
                Air Force training?
            </p>
            <p>
                A native of the ‘burbs of Chicago and a Blackhawks fan, Ryan spent his life leading up to joining the Air Force 
                in a rather directionless trudge through school, part of an engineering degree, and working in an auto shop. 
                At around 25, he decided he needed to pick a direction, and his father talked him down from joining the Chicago 
                police force to joining the Air Force.
            </p>
            <p>
                He signed up to be an Airborne Cryptologic Language Analyst and crossed his fingers that he wouldn’t be assigned 
                to learn Arabic, and so (of course) that is exactly what he ended up learning. The course was very challenging, but 
                he managed to scrape a pass (much to the surprise of his teachers, class, and especially himself at the time). 
                A year later, when he was due for his regular retest to ensure he was keeping up his language skill, he finally 
                felt genuine pride at his efforts with Arabic because he was able to pass on his own without the support of the 
                school environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                He worked operationally for about a year before he was offered the opportunity to go back to the Defense Language 
                Institute to learn Korean. This would open up opportunities to move to new places with his wife, who was a Korean 
                linguist, so he accepted. Unfortunately at the time – but ultimately fortunately – becoming a Korean linguist was 
                not in the cards for Ryan. This was a difficult time, but in the end it led to the opportunity for both himself 
                and his wife to retrain into the Cyber Warfare field within the Air Force.
            </p>
            <p>
                They made it through initial training, baffling their peers by being married and in all the same classes, and then 
                interviewed for and were accepted into the highly selective Offensive Cyber Operations training pipeline. They are 
                currently about a year into that two-year pipeline, which brings Ryan’s total training time in the Air Force to 
                nearly 8 out of the 9 years he has served.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ryan currently lives in San Antonio with his wife and two German Shepherds, Dizzy and Zumi. They are eagerly looking 
                forward to getting out of the South and enjoying someplace with four seasons and nice grass. Wherever they end up next, 
                Ryan hopes to be able to add home improvement of their very own house to his list of hobbies, which currently include 
                board games, online games, weightlifting (and other forms of exercise, such as hiking and bouldering), and hanging out 
                with his dogs.
